# wikiData
In this project the client would like the end user to select a record from a display list and then have the corresponding information displayed in four text boxes
on the left side of the interface. The end user should be able to search for an item which will be displayed in the four text boxes; after the search the search 
input box must clear and retains focus (cursor is inside the search text box) allowing the user to search for a new term.
The client requires that the end user has the option to add/edit/delete any of the four fields associated with an individual data structure record, the four fields 
are: Data Structure Name, Category, Structure and Definition. The user must be prompted via a popup box during the deletion process.
The prototype must use a two-dimensional array of type string to store each record. Refer to the program criteria to determine the exact size of the array, there is
no provision for additional data! A double mouse click in the name text box will clear all four text boxes and focus the cursor into the name text box.
The wiki prototype will load and save data when the appropriate button is clicked, and all the wiki data is stored/retrieved using a binary file format. During the 
load and save process the end user must have the option to select an alternative data file. All end user interactions must have full error trapping and feedback 
messaging via a status strip at the bottom of the interface.
